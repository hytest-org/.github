## Introduction
The HyTest Organization is a community promoting open, reproducible, and scalable approaches to all facets of the hydrological modeling enterprise.  Initiated as a collaboration between USGS and NCAR, we seek to build a diverse community of researchers and developers that focus on general challenges in the discipline.  

Following the successful approach of the [Pangeo Community](https://pangeo.io/), instead of buiding monolithic software environments, we seek out component tools and approaches widely used in the community.  We add value by testing them on our domain-specific workflows and by contributing enhancements.  

This approach has short-term, medium-term and long-term benefits by leveraging contributions by others, maintaining flexibility, and being future-proof:  with a broad community of developers and users, there will be a  pathway for whatever the future brings.
